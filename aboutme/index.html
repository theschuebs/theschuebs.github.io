				<p>I was born and raised in Libertyville, Illinois and recently found my way back to the Chicagoland area after an adventure teaching 6th graders in Arizona for eight years. I love the west, and I belong in the mountains...BUT my entire family is here, and home is where the family is. I grew up in a very German family that eats a lot of goulash and sp&auml;tzle, and whose motto is, "There's no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing.‚Äù

				<p>You might find me skiing, wake boarding, running, traveling, at a concert, or reading a book. Lately, the books have been about web development, a topic I am increasingly passionate about due to its logical and creative nature. I love learning, pushing my limits, and trying new things. Anything to make me a better human- as an individual and as a teammate- in this world.
